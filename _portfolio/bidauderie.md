## Explanation

[La Bidauderie](http://www.bidauderie-equitation.fr) is a showcasing website I made for an equestrian center located in France. It is the first project I did for a client, working as a freelancer. It represented an important challenge for me, as I was a young developer, and had to learn responsive design while working on the project.

The website is composed of 9 responsive pages displaying the company, its employees, its offers and rates, and also includes a customized contact form and a tool for users to enquire for an estimate.

I also worked on Search Engine Optimization, insuring the client a proper display, notably compared to its competition.

For this project, I delivered a complete service to the client, taking care of the design (wireframes, mockups), the content redaction, the responsive development and SEO.
