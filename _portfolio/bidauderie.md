## The project

[La Bidauderie](http://www.bidauderie-equitation.fr) is a showcasing website I made as a freelancer for an equestrian center located in France.

The website is composed of 9 responsive pages displaying the company, its employees, its offers and rates, and also includes a customized contact form and a tool for users to enquire for an estimate.

For this project, I delivered a complete service to the client, taking care of the design (wireframes & mockups), the content redaction, the responsive development and SEO.
