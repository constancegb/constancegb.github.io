## Explanation

**La Bidauderie** is a showcasing site for an equestrian center located in France. It is the first project I did for a client, in collaboration with Justine Dupuis, a student also from Bloc. My personal goal for this project, being my second project ever, was to learn to collaborate from distance on it.

## Problem

The website is composed of 8 pages displaying the company, its employees, its offers and rates, and also includes a customized contact form and a tool for users to enquire for an estimate. 

## Solution

To be consistent with each developer skills, we spread the tasks efficiently between us prior to any developemnt:

* Conception and mock-ups of the website: Constance
* Basic structure (HTML) and layouts (CSS): Justine
* Effects and interactivity using JS: Constance

Also, as all 8 pages of the website contains the same navbar and footer, we include them in a separate file that we injected in each pages's file, so that modifications on one or the other element can be done only in one place. 


## Conclusion

During this project, we were two young developers learning to collaborate for the first time, so we had to read resources on how to do it efficiently to avoid conflicts in the code. We encountered several bugs along the way, (you know what they say, we learn from our mistakes!) but that we were always able to fix. This process of learning by making mistakes, in this case, proved to be very efficient as collaborating is now something we can both do with our eyes closed?
