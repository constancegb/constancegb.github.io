## The project

**Bloc-Jams** is an online ad-free music player.
The app is responsive and composed of a landing page where the features of the app are displayed, a collection page showing all albums available to play, and an album page displaying all songs of the album, that is the place where users can play, pause, skip or forward or song, and change its volume.
