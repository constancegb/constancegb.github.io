short-description: A platform to deploy artificial intelligence in industrial operations

## The project

I started my current job at [Fieldbox.ai](https://fieldbox.ai) in October 2018 as a Frontend developer. The company sells its platform to industrials in order to accompany them into the deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in their industrial operations.

As a member of a 10-developer team, the Frontend mission is composed of the following:
- Migrating the existing stack towards ReactJS, with a focus on improving the user experience
- Conceptualizing and developing new screens for both internal & external usage
- Managing the existing codebase: solving bugs & building new features in response to clients requests
