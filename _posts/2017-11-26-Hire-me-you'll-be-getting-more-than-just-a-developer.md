title: Hire me! You'll get more than a Software Developer
---
As for today, I have been doing code for about a year. I am 24 years old, so you might be wondering: what the ******** did I do/lose-my-time-with before?  Well, it is indeed a good question, but I am sorry to say you asked it poorly. I did not lose my time ok?  Kidding aside, let me tell you how and why I came to start web development. I swear it is a terrific story, the kind you want to tell your kids before they go to sleep.

Priorly, I was enrolled at ESG Management School Paris (now PSB). After a year studying abroad at Boston University, I took an exam to do a Master in Entrepreneurship & Innovation at IESEG Paris (La DÃ©fense Campus). During my first professional experiences, I have been given important responsibilities in web design, something I was not familiar with.

During a 3-month internship at Genialis, an R&D company, I did the UI of their hitherto inexistent website. This was my first contact with web design, and even though back then I did not possess any knowledge of it nor any tool to practice it, I very much enjoyed the mission as a whole.

Then I did a gap internship of 6 months at Propulss, a startup specialized in real-estate crowdfunding. While the co-founder left the company after a month of me being there (obviously without any causal link, I am disappointed you even wondered), I took care of all his responsibilities, including the graphic recast of the platform, giving me a little more knowledge and experience in web design.

Later on, I worked as a freelancer for a few months. One my client was [Seaver](http://seaverhorse.com/), (previously Arion Horse) a promising startup working on a prototype of a horse strap, connected to a mobile app to measure horse performance. I was in charge of designing the app from scratch, and here are some of the 50 wireframes I made for the company.

One of my favorite project I work on was the end-of-study project I did in my Business School. It reunited both of the subjects I love working on: Entrepreneurship & Design. The project consisted in establishing a detailed Business Plan for the business idea of our choice, and I chose to develop a marketplace where brands could target digital influencers based on their audience demographics, and offer them marketing campaigns to be shared on their social networks. I called the platform *Creatorz*.

This is the very project that took me into web development. Indeed, while scratching my head on designing the best User Experience possible, I came to realized all the logic needed behind the scenes, all the 'if the user clicks this' then 'display that' stuff; and something about it just gave me goosebumps. Just like that, web development and software engineering got me, and before I knew it, I was enrolled at Bloc, a Californian institute where I followed the Software Developer track.
