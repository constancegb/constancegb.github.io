title: Starting my journey into web development
---
I found that starting to code for a professional purpose can be a lot to take when you begin, and sometimes you may feel, or at least it was the case for me, that you do not know where to start. Hence, for my very first article as a young developer, I wanted to present a certain learning process, not  one that I would have scrupulously applied myself, but rather, one that takes into accounts the mistakes I made or the possible improvements for a smoother experience.

I insist that there is not one ideal path that has to be followed, and my general advice would be to use as many resources as you can. Indeed, not a single website can pretend to teach you how to code without relying on external resources. Even the extensive program I paid for rely on other websites such as [Codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/) or [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). And you will often here that even experienced programmers rely heavily on Google to code. That being said, let's dive into the substance of this article.

**Getting your hands on HTML & CSS**

If you want to start learning web development, you have to start with HTML & CSS. HTML lays the structure of all websites, it is the language in which you define which element you want to display: some text, an image, a link, a frame, and so on. CSS allows you to give style to those elements, by defining their size, the position towards other elements, the color and even do basic animations with those elements.

You will find heaps of resources on the matter. [OpenClassroom](https://openclassrooms.com/courses?q=&idx=prod_v2_COURSES_fr&p=0&fR[certificate][0]=true&fR[isWeb][0]=true&hFR[category.name][0]=D%C3%A9veloppement%20web) has a 20-hour free introduction course that lays all the basis of HTML and CSS. [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is a good place to start exercising for free, but if you can, I would recommend Codeschool instead. Subscriptions are $30 per month, and the content is far more qualitative.

>To wrap up everything that you have learnt in HTML & CSS, a smart exercise would be to take any recent website like Airbnb, and replicate it on your own. For that, you will need to take a quick course  and the Command Line and GitHub to manage your project.

**Best practices**

When starting to make a copy of the website of your choice, or for any other projects, there are some tools that will assist you along the way. If you ever get stuck, the first place to look might be [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and it is even likely that someone with the same issue as you has already asked for help on the forum. [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) is to me the most complete library that you can use to look for how to code a certain element, or what a certain property does. Websites such as [FlatIcon](flaticon.com) or [FlatUiColors](flatuicolors.com) are pretty useful when you want to start your own project, like a personnal website for instance.

**Going further**

An excellent resourse to go further is [Pluralsight](pluralsight.com), where subscriptions cost $29 a month. You can get your skills assessed on any topic, you have access to over 5000 courses on development, you get mentored for when you get stuck and so on. Depending on what is your ultimate goal in web development, it might be a good idea to continue your learning path with JavaScript. Once you get your head around it, [JavaScript30](javascript30.com) is an excellent free app where you are guided through 30 different JavaScript project with video tutorials.

To test your hability to solve mathematical problems and come up with smart algorithms, Codewarsprovides challenges that you can solve using JavaScript or the programming language of your choice, and its community is very active.

Finally, my last advice would be "Learn by doing". If you want to progress quickly, take an ambitious project, and start building it bits by bits, resorting to Stackoverflow or any similar resource when you get stuck. As Einstein said, 

>“Never memorize something that you can look up.” - Albert Einstein

So do not panic if down the road you feel like you are not retaining everything, because you can't! You can keep notes on a drive for stuff that you often forget, and by using it in more and more projects, it will soon become natural to you.
